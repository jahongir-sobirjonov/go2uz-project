- The goal of this project is to unite Tour service agencies on one platform. 
- This platform is prepared in the form of Application (Flutter) for Users and web form for ADMIN and AGENCIES.
- Agencies post their tours and users can book these tours. Payment systems for users are also integrated.
- When choosing a Tour, users can select the Tour and Agnecy's rating based on the comments left for it.
- Users can filter by price, date, location and category.
